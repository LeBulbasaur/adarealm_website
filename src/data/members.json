            "description": "My first dip into Crypto started over 3years ago in the BSC space, this was a fantastic learning curve for me. Having experienced many aspects such as being involved in building a community, creating sustainable tokanomics and working within a team to launch a number of successful projects. My favourite role has always been my involvement with the community and networking with like minded projects. This mindset of community first brought me into the Cardano space - a space where innovation is at the forefront of development.",
