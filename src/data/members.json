Having experienced many aspects such as being involved in building a community, creating sustainable tokanomics and working within a team to launch a number of successful projects. My favourite role has always been my involvement with the community and networking with like minded projects. This mindset of community first brought me into the Cardano space - a space where innovation is at the forefront of development.",

But really like (C)NFTâ€™s and most off all the communities behind them. We're still early altough one day in crypto feels like an week.",
